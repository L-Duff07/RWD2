	<h1>O'Sullivan scrapes past White in Champion of Champions</h1>
	<p><b>Veteran Jimmy White was beaten 4-3 by Ronnie O'Sullivan after their Champion of Champions match in Coventry went to a deciding frame.</p></b>

<p>The 57-year-old, a World Championship runner-up on six occasions, won the first three frames before the five-time Crucible champion bounced back.</p>

<p>White, winner of the World Seniors title in August, missed a crucial red when 29 ahead in the final frame.</p>

<p>O'Sullivan returned later to beat John Higgins 6-3 and book a semi-final spot.</p>

<p>He will face Neil Robertson in the last four on Friday, while Mark Allen takes on Judd Trump in Saturday's other semi-final.</p>

<p>The meeting of snooker greats White and O'Sullivan attracted a sell-out crowd at the Ricoh Arena.</p>

<p>And they looked set to witness a major upset as White hit a 56 break in taking the opener, and then won the next two frames.</p>

<p>World number three O'Sullivan, 43, pulled the score back to 3-2 but White was 38-0 ahead in the sixth frame before an unfortunate kick on the black helped turned the match around.</p>
